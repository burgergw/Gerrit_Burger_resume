        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>My name is Gerrit Burger and I am a 23 year old web development student from Malmesbury. 
            I grew up on a farm until the age of eight, before moving to town where my parents started their businesses. 
            Growing up, i had a keen interests in aviation, music and technology, and have been perusing those interests throughout my life.
            I started taking music lessons when I was eight and music has played a big part of my life ever since. I perused my passion for 
            aviation by completing my Private Pilots License after finishing highschool. I am currently perusing my interest in technology by studying web development

        <h2>Projects i am working on:</h2>
        <p>A project i have been working on is an online store with a shopping cart. When the user opens the website, they are greeted with the landing page and can navigate the website with the nav bar at the top of every page.
            The user can click on an item on the catalogue page they want to purchase to read more information and add it to their shopping cart. On the shopping cart page, every item will be displayed that the user has added to their shopping cart and a total will be calculated.
            There are also forms on the shopping cart page for the user to select delivery options as well as enter a coupon code, which will give them a discount on their order. The user can then place their order and the total will be displayed and a reference number will be generated.
